I am a Ph.D. student at [https://ece.princeton.edu/ Princeton University] advised by Professor [https://jasondlee88.github.io/index.html Jason D. Lee] and [https://yuxinchen2020.github.io/ Yuxin Chen].\n
Before that, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Electronic Engineering from [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Tsinghua University].\n
